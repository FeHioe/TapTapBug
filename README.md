# TapTapBug
A single-player browser game where players kill bugs on the screen trying to eat randomly located food. It is a time-based game where each play takes 60 seconds, and ends when either the time is up or when the bugs have eaten all the food. There are three types of bugs: black, red, and orange. Black bugs are the fastest and the orange bugs are the slowest; the faster the bug, the higher the kill score.
